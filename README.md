This repo is for a University course under Emmanouil Vavalis,Professor and Antonia Nasiakou.

I DO NOT own or am in any way involved with the Gridlabd project.


-------------------------------------------------------
INCLUDED:

- The gridlabd trunk, where changes have been made in the generators, market and residential folders. Instructions on how to build the corresponding projects and produce the dll files have been given to Antonia Nasiakou. Note that the residential project has some known issues. Antonia is aware and fully capable to explain them.


- A folder containing the produced dll files (market.dll and generators.dll) along with the glm files gridlabd uses. There is also the output gridlabd generated.


- The final project report in pdf format.
